# 🧠 Go Backend Server Setup Guide

Follow these steps to build and run the backend server:

## 1. 📥 Install Go

Make sure **Go (version 1.21 or higher)** is installed and added to your system PATH.  
👉 [Download it here](https://go.dev/dl/)

---

## 2. 📂 Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Photo-Management-App/Go-Server.git
cd go-server
```

---

## 3. 🏗️ Build the Server

To compile the server and generate the executable, run:
```bash
go build
```

This will create:
- `server.exe` on **Windows**
- `server` binary on **Linux/macOS**

---

## 4. 🚀 Run the Server

Start the server with the appropriate command:

```bash
./server.exe   # On Windows
./server       # On Linux/macOS
```

---

## 5. 🧪 (Optional) Run Example Scripts

Example bash scripts are located in the `examples/` directory.  
To run a script:
```bash
./examples/<file>.sh
```

> 💡 Use **Git Bash**, **WSL**, or a **Linux terminal** on Windows to run `.sh` scripts.
